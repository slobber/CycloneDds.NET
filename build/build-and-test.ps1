#
# PURPOSE:
#   The primary developer entry point.
#   1. Checks for native artifacts (builds them if missing).
#   2. Builds the core Managed Solution (CycloneDDS.NET.Core.slnf).
#   3. Runs all tests in the core solution filter.
#
#   The full CycloneDDS.NET.sln also contains example projects (e.g. HelloWorld)
#   that consume CycloneDDS.NET as a NuGet *package* from artifacts/nuget, which
#   only exists after `dotnet pack` (see build/pack.ps1). Those examples are
#   therefore excluded here; build them via .\build\pack.ps1 after packing.
#
# USAGE:
#   .\build\build-and-test.ps1 [-Configuration Release|Debug] [-Clean]
# ===================================================================================
