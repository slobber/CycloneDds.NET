# DDS Monitor

DDS Monitor is a real-time DDS network monitoring tool built on Blazor Server. It subscribes to DDS topics, displays samples in high-performance virtualized grids, tracks keyed instance lifecycles, and supports filtering, sorting, message replay, export, and domain-specific plugin extensibility.


The DdsMonitor tool exposes a comprehensive feature set for interacting with DDS networks, underpinned by a highly modular, extensible Blazor-based architecture. Here is a breakdown of its core capabilities from a user perspective:

**Network Configuration & Topic Discovery**
*   **Multi-Participant Configuration:** Users can configure multiple DDS participants concurrently by specifying Domain ID and Partition Name pairs through the Participant Editor.
*   **Dynamic Topic Discovery:** The tool dynamically loads external DLL assemblies containing generated schema types (`TopicSourcesPanel`).
*   **Topic Explorer:** A master list provides an overview of all discovered topics, showing live metrics like sample counts, instances, and sparklines for frequency. Users can dynamically subscribe or unsubscribe from topics, or use "Subscribe All".

**Sample Visualization & Grid Layouts**
*   **Targeted and Global Views:** Users can open a `SamplesPanel` for a specific topic or a global "All Samples" view. 
*   **Data Grid Customization:** The grid uses virtualization for high performance. Users can pick custom columns, resize them, and toggle track mode to automatically scroll to the latest sample. Layouts can be exported and imported as `.samplepanelsettings` files.
*   **Filtering and Sorting:** The grid supports sorting by clicking headers and robust filtering. The tool includes a visual Filter Builder generating expressions (e.g., `Payload.Field == 42`) powered by Dynamic LINQ. 
*   **Transport Controls:** Global transport controls allow the user to Play (resume receiving), Pause (stop accepting new samples), and Reset (clear all stores and ordinal counters) the DDS bridge.

**Deep Inspection**
*   **Detail Panel:** When a sample is selected, the `DetailPanel` inspects the payload in multiple formats. Users can view data as a hierarchical collapsible tree, a flattened table, or raw JSON.
*   **Metadata & Sender Tracking:** Aside from the payload, the detail view surfaces DDS `SampleInfo` (timestamp, instance state) and extracted sender metadata (Process ID, Process Name, Machine IP) via receiver-only sender monitoring.
*   **Link/Detach Modes:** The detail panel can be "linked" to follow the active selection in a source grid, or detached/pinned to inspect a specific sample while continuing to browse.

**Data Injection & Playback**
*   **Sample Authoring:** The `SendSamplePanel` uses schema reflection to build a `DynamicForm` matching the topic's structure (handling nested types, unions, arrays, etc.). Users can manually author payloads and inject them into the network.
*   **Clone to Send:** Existing samples can be cloned directly into the send panel for rapid modification and re-transmission.
*   **Record and Replay:** Replay capabilities let users load exported JSON streams. Users can pause, step, jump to specific frames/times, and control playback speed. Samples can be replayed purely into the local UI store for inspection, or routed back into the live DDS network.

**Windowing & Workspace Management**
*   **Floating Window Manager:** The UI functions like a desktop environment with movable, resizable, and minimizable panels. Multiple instances of the same panel (e.g., two `SamplesPanels` for the same or different topics) are supported via unique panel IDs.
*   **Workspace Persistence:** The complete layout, active filters, selected columns, and subscription states are automatically debounced and saved to a `workspace.json` file. Users can also manually export/import workspace layouts.

**Plugin System & Extensibility**
*   The architecture is heavily decoupled, providing isolated `AssemblyLoadContext` environments for plugins. Key extension points include:
    *   **Custom Panels & Menus:** Plugins can register their own Blazor panels (`PluginPanelRegistry`) and inject items into the global top menu or row-level context menus.
    *   **Custom Sample Views:** The `ISampleViewRegistry` allows plugins to completely replace the default tree view for specific CLR types (e.g., the Feature Demo plugin rendering a custom "Demo Payload Viewer").
    *   **Value Formatters:** `IValueFormatterRegistry` allows plugins to provide Tier 1 syntax-highlighted inline representations of custom types (e.g., rendering `GeoCoord` objects seamlessly in grid cells).
    *   **Filter Macros & Export:** Plugins can inject custom macros into the Dynamic LINQ filter engine and register custom export formats.

**CLI & Headless Operations**
*   **Headless Mode:** The engine can run purely from the CLI without the Blazor UI (`HeadlessMode.Record` or `HeadlessMode.Replay`), piping live data straight to disk or streaming a file to the network.
*   **CLI Overrides:** Users can pass arguments (e.g., `--AppSettings:IncludeTopics`, `--NoBrowser true`) to override workspace configuration, enabling CI/CD integrations or constrained debugging sessions.

**Diagnostics & Statistics**
*   **Performance Counters:** A live statistics overlay tracks total samples, total bytes received, and bandwidth rates (MB/s). It also measures samples-per-second on the ingestion hot-path to diagnose bottlenecks.
*   **Devel Mode:** Allows developers to toggle high-frequency "self-sending" of mock data to stress-test the ingestion pipeline up to 10 kHz.

## Running DDS Monitor

```
DdsMonitor.exe [options]
```

By default DDS Monitor starts a Kestrel HTTP server on a random free port and launches Chrome (or Edge, or the system default browser) in app mode. The application shuts down automatically when all browser tabs close.

---

## Command-Line Arguments

All options follow the ASP.NET Core `--Section:Key=Value` naming convention. Options with array values use colon-indexed paths (`:0=`, `:1=`, …).

### Application Settings (`AppSettings`)

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |

## Topic Inclusion and Exclusion

DDS Monitor starts by auto-subscribing to every known topic. You can narrow the subscription set in three ways: interactively via the UI, via CLI flags on each launch, or persistently via the saved workspace.

### Interactive unsubscription

Uncheck the subscription checkbox next to any topic in the **Topics** panel. The change is debounced and saved to `workspace.json` within ~2 seconds. On the next launch, the topic remains unsubscribed.

Closing the browser (or the browser tab) flushes any pending save before the process exits, so changes made right at shutdown are not lost.

### CLI include/exclude patterns

CLI patterns override the saved workspace on each launch but do **not** modify the workspace file — interactive sessions and saved state are untouched.

```
# Subscribe to only one topic
DdsMonitor.exe --AppSettings:IncludeTopics:0=MyApp.Telemetry

# Subscribe to an entire namespace
DdsMonitor.exe --AppSettings:IncludeTopics:0="MyApp.*"

# Subscribe to everything except diagnostics
DdsMonitor.exe --AppSettings:ExcludeTopics:0="MyApp.Diagnostics.*"

# Combine: include a namespace but exclude one noisy type within it
DdsMonitor.exe --AppSettings:IncludeTopics:0="MyApp.*" ^
               --AppSettings:ExcludeTopics:0="MyApp.HeartBeat"

# Multiple patterns (zero-indexed array syntax):
DdsMonitor.exe --AppSettings:ExcludeTopics:0="Ns.TypeA" ^
               --AppSettings:ExcludeTopics:1="Ns.TypeB"
```

### Pattern syntax

Patterns match against the **fully-qualified CLR type name** of the topic (e.g. `MyNamespace.MyTopicType`). Matching is case-sensitive.

| Wildcard | Matches |
|---|---|
| `*` | Any sequence of characters, including `.` |
| `?` | Any single character |
| *(no wildcard)* | Exact full-name match |

Examples:
- `MyApp.Telemetry` — exact match
- `MyApp.*` — all types in namespace `MyApp` (and sub-namespaces)
- `*.Pose` — all types whose name ends in `Pose`
- `MyApp.?ensor` — matches `MyApp.Sensor`, `MyApp.Tensor`, etc.

### Precedence rules

1. **CLI `IncludeTopics`** — if set: start with all topics excluded; topics matching an include pattern are subscribed; topics also matching an exclude pattern are removed again. Saved workspace exclusions are ignored.
2. **CLI `ExcludeTopics` only** — start with all topics subscribed; topics matching the pattern are excluded. Saved workspace exclusions are ignored.
3. **No CLI flags** — use the `ExcludedTopics` list in `workspace.json` to restore the previous interactive session's subscription state.

CLI flags do not persist: the workspace file is **not written** during a CLI-controlled session, so saved state from the previous interactive session is fully preserved for the next interactive launch.

---

## Loading Topics from Assemblies

DDS Monitor obtains its knowledge of available DDS topic types in two ways:

1. **Plugins** — DLLs in `DdsSettings:PluginDirectories` may register topic types programmatically through the plugin API.
2. **Assembly scanning** — DDS Monitor scans arbitrary directories (or individual DLL files) for .NET assemblies that contain types decorated with `[DdsTopic]` / `[DdsKey]` attributes. These are configured via the **Topic Sources** list and stored in `assembly-sources.json`.

The rest of this section focuses on assembly scanning.

### How topic discovery works

On startup `AssemblySourceService` reads each path from the sources list (file or CLI override). For each path it:

1. Resolves the path — if it is a directory, enumerates every `*.dll` in that directory; if it is a single DLL file, uses it directly.
2. Loads each DLL inside an isolated `AssemblyLoadContext`. Each source gets its own context so assemblies with the same name but different versions do not conflict.
3. Scans all exported types looking for `[DdsTopic]` markers (from `CycloneDDS.NET` or compatible attribute ducks).
4. Registers discovered topic descriptors with `ITopicRegistry`, making them available for DDS subscriptions and sample decoding.

Load errors for individual DLLs are captured and displayed in the **File → Topic Sources…** panel; they do not prevent other sources from loading.

### Managing sources in the UI

Open **File → Topic Sources…** to add, remove, or reorder the persisted scanning paths:

- **Add** — opens a directory browser; the selected path is appended and scanned immediately.
- **Remove** — removes the selected entry from the list; previously decoded descriptors remain available for the current session but are not re-loaded on next launch.
- **Move Up / Move Down** — reorder the list (affects scan order but usually not observable since each source uses an isolated context).

Changes are saved to `assembly-sources.json` automatically after every modification.

### CLI override without persisting

To scan a different set of assembly directories for a single launch **without overwriting** the saved `assembly-sources.json`, use `--AppSettings:TopicSources`:

```
# Scan a single directory
DdsMonitor.exe --AppSettings:TopicSources:0="C:\MyApp\bin\Debug\net10.0"

# Scan two directories
DdsMonitor.exe --AppSettings:TopicSources:0="C:\MyApp\bin\Debug\net10.0" ^
               --AppSettings:TopicSources:1="C:\SharedTopics\bin\Release\net10.0"

# Point at a specific DLL instead of a whole directory
DdsMonitor.exe --AppSettings:TopicSources:0="C:\MyApp\bin\Debug\net10.0\MyTopics.dll"
```

When `--AppSettings:TopicSources` is non-empty:

- The `assembly-sources.json` file is **not read** — the CLI list is used instead.
- The `assembly-sources.json` file is **not written** during the session — your saved sources are untouched.
- The **File → Topic Sources…** panel shows a notice banner and disables the Add / Remove / Move buttons for the duration of the session.

This is useful in CI/CD pipelines, scripted record/replay sessions, or developer workflows where you want to point at an output directory without affecting the shared configuration.

---

## Persistent Storage

### Workspace file

**Default path:** `%APPDATA%\DdsMonitor\workspace.json`

Stores the complete UI state: open panels, their positions/sizes, and the list of explicitly unsubscribed topics. Written automatically whenever the UI state changes (debounced ~2 s).

**File structure:**
```json
{
  "Panels": [
    {
      "PanelId": "TopicExplorerPanel.1",
      "ComponentTypeName": "DdsMonitor.Components.TopicExplorerPanel",
      "Title": "Topics",
      "X": 40, "Y": 40, "Width": 840, "Height": 300,
      "ZIndex": 2, "IsHidden": false, "IsMinimized": false,
      "ComponentState": {}
    }
  ],
  "ExcludedTopics": [
    "MyApp.HeartBeat",
    "MyApp.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounters"
  ]
}
```

`ExcludedTopics` may be omitted (for "subscribe to everything") or may contain exact type names or glob patterns. Exclusion names for topics from DLL assemblies that failed to load are preserved verbatim and re-applied when the assembly becomes available again.

### Assembly sources file

**Default path:** `%APPDATA%\DdsMonitor\assembly-sources.json`

Lists directories that DDS Monitor scans for DLL assemblies containing DDS topic types. Managed via **File → Topic Sources…** in the UI, or by editing the file directly.

**File structure:** a JSON array of directory paths (scanning finds every `.dll` in the directory):
```json
[
  "C:\\MyApp\\bin\\Debug\\net10.0",
  "C:\\SharedTopics\\bin\\Release\\net10.0"
]
```

DLLs are loaded in an isolated `AssemblyLoadContext` so they cannot conflict with each other or with the monitor itself. If a DLL fails to load the error is recorded in the Topic Sources panel but does not affect other sources.

### Config folder override

Both files are co-located. To move them to a different directory, use `--AppSettings:ConfigFolder`:

```
DdsMonitor.exe --AppSettings:ConfigFolder="D:\Projects\MyApp\ddsmon-config"
```

This is useful in CI/CD pipelines or to maintain per-project configurations.

---

## Loading a Specific Layout File

To start with a fixed layout (panel arrangement + exclusion list) from a file, bypassing the default per-user workspace:

```
DdsMonitor.exe --AppSettings:WorkspaceFile="D:\Configs\my-layout.json"
```

When `WorkspaceFile` is set:
- The exact file is loaded on startup regardless of `ConfigFolder`.
- Changes to the UI are saved **back to the same file** so the custom layout is also persisted.

**Force a read-only layout (do not persist changes):** pass both `WorkspaceFile` and at least one of `IncludeTopics`/`ExcludeTopics`. The CLI topic-filter guard prevents `workspace.json` from being written in CLI-controlled sessions, effectively making the layout read-only for that launch.

**Tip:** Export the current layout from the UI via **File → Export Layout**, edit as needed (strip `ExcludedTopics`, reposition panels, etc.), and use the resulting file as a shareable baseline.

---

## Startup Filter Expression

A global filter applied to **all** incoming samples before they enter the sample store. Samples that do not match are silently dropped; they never appear in any grid or counter.

```
DdsMonitor.exe --DdsSettings:FilterExpression="Payload.Status eq 2"
```

**Expression syntax** (Dynamic LINQ + alphabetical operator aliases):

| Alias | Operator | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `eq` | `==` | `Payload.Id eq 42` |
| `ne` | `!=` | `Payload.State ne 0` |
| `gt` | `>` | `Payload.Speed gt 100.0` |
| `lt` | `<` | `Payload.Temperature lt -10` |
| `ge` | `>=` | `Payload.Count ge 5` |
| `le` | `<=` | `Payload.Level le 3` |

The standard symbolic operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) are also accepted. The alphabetical aliases exist because the shell may interpret `<` and `>` as redirections.

**Field access:** use `Payload.<FieldName>` or `Sample.<FieldName>` to reference topic fields. Nested fields use dot-notation: `Payload.Position.X`. String fields support `.Contains("x")`, `.StartsWith("x")`, and `.EndsWith("x")`.

**Examples:**
```
# Numeric comparison
--DdsSettings:FilterExpression="Payload.Id ge 100 and Payload.Id le 200"

# String match
--DdsSettings:FilterExpression="Payload.Name.StartsWith(\"Robot\")"

# Multiple topics — filter applies to every subscribed topic
--DdsSettings:FilterExpression="Payload.Status eq 1 or Payload.Active eq true"
```

The same expression syntax is used in the per-panel **filter builder** in the UI (which does use symbolic operators since they are typed rather than shell-escaped).

---

## Plugin System

Plugins extend DDS Monitor with domain-specific panels, visualisations, and menu items. They are loaded as isolated DLLs from directories listed in `DdsSettings:PluginDirectories`.

**Default directory:** `plugins\` relative to the executable. The Debug build copies BDC plugin output there automatically.

**Custom directories:**
```
DdsMonitor.exe --DdsSettings:PluginDirectories:0="plugins" ^
               --DdsSettings:PluginDirectories:1="D:\MyApp\ddsmon-plugins"
```

Plugin DLLs that cannot be loaded (missing dependencies, wrong architecture, etc.) are silently skipped so a broken plugin does not prevent the monitor from starting.

---

## Multi-Participant and Partition Configuration

To monitor topics on multiple DDS domains simultaneously, or topics visible only within specific partitions, configure additional participants:

```
DdsMonitor.exe --DdsSettings:Participants:0:DomainId=0 ^
               --DdsSettings:Participants:0:PartitionName="" ^
               --DdsSettings:Participants:1:DomainId=5 ^
               --DdsSettings:Participants:1:PartitionName="sim"
```

Or in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "DdsSettings": {
    "Participants": [
      { "DomainId": 0, "PartitionName": "" },
      { "DomainId": 5, "PartitionName": "sim" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Samples from all participants flow into the same store and grids. The **Ordinal**, **DomainId**, and **Partition** columns in the sample grid identify the origin of each sample.

The legacy shorthand `--DdsSettings:DomainId=<n>` is equivalent to `Participants:0:DomainId=<n>` and is kept for backward compatibility.

---

## Self-Send (Developer Mode)

Self-send injects a stream of synthetic samples for two built-in topics (`DdsMonitor.Engine.SelfTestSimple` and `DdsMonitor.Engine.SelfTestPose`). It is useful for testing the UI and pipeline without a live DDS network.

Toggle from the **Devel** menu in the UI, or enable on startup:

```
DdsMonitor.exe --DdsSettings:SelfSendEnabled=true ^
               --DdsSettings:SelfSendRateHz=10 ^
               --DdsSettings:SelfSendKeyCount=3
```

Self-send topics respect the same inclusion/exclusion rules as external topics — they can be suppressed with `--AppSettings:ExcludeTopics:0=DdsMonitor.Engine.*`.

---

## Headless Record and Replay

Headless mode runs without a browser or HTTP server. It is useful in pipelines and automated testing.

### Record mode — capture live DDS traffic to a file

```
DdsMonitor.exe --DdsSettings:HeadlessMode=Record ^
               --DdsSettings:HeadlessFilePath="capture.json"
```

Optionally restrict which topics are recorded:

```
DdsMonitor.exe --DdsSettings:HeadlessMode=Record ^
               --DdsSettings:HeadlessFilePath="capture.json" ^
               --AppSettings:IncludeTopics:0="MyApp.*"
```

The process runs until `Ctrl+C`. The output file is a JSON array; each entry has `Ordinal`, `TopicTypeName`, `Timestamp`, `DomainId`, `PartitionName`, `Sender`, `InstanceState`, and `Payload`.

### Replay mode — publish recorded samples back to the network

```
DdsMonitor.exe --DdsSettings:HeadlessMode=Replay ^
               --DdsSettings:HeadlessFilePath="capture.json" ^
               --DdsSettings:ReplayRate=2.0
```

Optional sample filter (same syntax as `FilterExpression`):

```
DdsMonitor.exe --DdsSettings:HeadlessMode=Replay ^
               --DdsSettings:HeadlessFilePath="capture.json" ^
               --DdsSettings:FilterExpression="Payload.Status eq 1"
```

The process exits automatically when replay is complete.
